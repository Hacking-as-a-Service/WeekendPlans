Target: Haywire Inc. (Those self-driving car jokers)
=====================================================

Intel:
------
Haywire's GitHub is riddled with holes. Downloaded a bunch of internal code – seems their security is about as functional as a one-wheeled Tesla.
Found a juicy project called "Autobahn" – looks like their core autonomous driving program. Jackpot.
System access seems to be through a web portal called "Haywire Hub." Weak sauce security protocols based on initial recon.

Attack Plan:
------------
Backdoor Blitz: Craft a custom backdoor Trojan disguised as a system update for Autobahn. This puppy will give me permanent access to their network.
Joyriding the System: Once inside, I'll use Autobahn's code to remotely hijack one of their test vehicles. Imagine the chaos!
Hold Haywire Hostage: With a hijacked car as leverage, I can demand a hefty ransom from Haywire. Those self-driving dreams will turn into a nightmare for them
Bonus Round (Maybe): If I'm feeling spicy, I might leak some of Haywire's self-driving secrets to the competition. Just to stir the pot.

Timeline:
---------
This week: Finalize backdoor Trojan and test it in a sandbox environment.
Next week: Launch the attack and gain access to Haywire Hub.
Week after: Hijack a car and deploy the ransom message. Haywire will be begging for mercy!

Notes to Self:
--------------
Gotta find a way to wipe my tracks after the hack. Can't leave any digital breadcrumbs.
Maybe invest in a new keyboard. This one's getting a little too enthusiastic with the emojis...
